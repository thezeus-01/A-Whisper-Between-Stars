    <p class="proposal-text"> Dear Shruuthi,</p>

    <p class="proposal-text">I like you, from the moment I saw your profile 💖. Those eyes were like Reyna to me 👀.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">When we met in real life, you were a bit tall 🫣 — I couldn’t even open my mouth that day. That scene is still in my eyes, like it happened just now.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">When you said "I don’t want to miss the person who’s like me," something clicked inside me.</p>

    <!-- New added lines -->
    <p class="proposal-text">I would really like to know more about you — your thoughts, your dreams, your little quirks that make you, you. 🌸</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">I wonder about the things that make you laugh, the songs that you secretly love, and the little moments that brighten your day. 💭</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">I hope we can share more memories, learn about each other, and create moments that we’ll always remember together. ✨</p>

    <p class="proposal-text">I don’t want to live in guilt that I never told you this. I might have disturbed you with my frequent messages 😔.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">You never messaged me first (except that one time you asked "What are you doing?"). I can give you my word that I will never break your trust.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">If you want me to change something about myself, I will — step by step.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">One thing — I never looked at you as just a friend. I cannot be your "friend till the end".</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">If you didn’t see this last message on this page, it’s okay. I will delete your number, unfollow Insta, and never disturb you again.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">Happy Married Life in advance 💍✨. One last thing: please find a proper guy. Don’t just take a random decision right now.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">If you made it till this page — guess what, you are the only one who will ever see this.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">🎮 If your answer is NO, don’t worry about me. I’ll just be in my room, playing games, learning, and building my career.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text">Like you said — everything is temporary. Either I marry you or I explore the world and find happiness on my own 🌍✨.</p>

    <p class="proposal-text">It's true, I'm just a simple guy, but I believe I'm a good one, especially for you.</p>
    <p class="proposal-text bigger-text bold-text">And my biggest wish is that I would like to marry you. ❤️</p>
    <p class="proposal-text bigger-text bold-text">I promise to make our everyday moments special, no matter how small. ✨</p>

   


    <p class="proposal-text mt-30">So, what do you say ?</p>
    <div class="button-group">
      <a href="{{ url_for('waiting_question') }}" class="heart-button">Yes, I'm ready for the next step!</a>
      <a href="{{ url_for('final_page') }}" class="heart-button decline">No, not yet.</a>
